                                to monitor the drink's current temperature. The
                                hot plate heats up the drink to maintain the
                                desired temperature as necessary. Once the
                                desired temperature is reached, a buzzer goes
                                off alerting the user the drink is ready.

                            <h3>Why?</h3>
                            <p>
                                I like my hot beverages not scalding, but on the
                                lower end of the average temperature range.
                                Problem is, that it takes a long time for a
                                freshly brewed cup of coffee to reach the
                                temperature I like it at. Even worse, since I
                                like the temperature to be lower than average,
                                the temperature can quickly drop below the
                                temperature I like and just end up plain old
                                cold. I will often make a drink but then forget
                                about it while I wait for it to cool, so this is
                                designed to help prevent that from happening.

                                The Intelli-Lock is a home security system that
                                schedules when the door it's installed in should
                                be locked or not, as well as granting access to
                                users with valid keycards. There is an internal
                                button to allow users to exit from within the
                                locked area. The device also contains a buzzer
                                that will go off depending on if access is
                                granted or not.

                            <p>
                                System is designed as an Arduino shield that can
                                be installed directly ontop of an Arduino. The
                                system uses an RFID pcb to scan the user's
                                keycard. Realtime Clock module used for device
                                to track current time. Micro servo used to allow
                                precise movements for locking/unlocking the
                                door.

                            <h3>Why?</h3>
                            <p>
                                Unautomated security systems are an
                                inconvenience for workers in a store who are
                                trying to lock up for the day, as customers can
                                enter the store past closing time due to the
                                doors not being locked automatically when the
                                store closes for the night. The Intelli-Lock
                                system is designed to ease that pain and to
                                improve the closing procedures for a store.
