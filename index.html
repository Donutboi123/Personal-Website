                <h2>
                    Growing up, I was fortunate to spend much of my childhood at
                    Walt Disney World. Those countless trips immersed me in a
                    world where every detail was carefully designed to create a
                    sense of wonder. While most guests were content to
                    experience the Disney Magic, I was always looking for the
                    mechanisms behind it. Looking up when others looked down,
                    studying ride tracks and show systems, I discovered that
                    understanding how things worked did not diminish the magic,
                    but deepened it.
                </h2>

        <h3 class="main2">
            That curiosity eventually grew into something more. I began to
            understand not just how things worked but to imagine how they could
            work differently. What alternative designs might create new
            experiences? What possibilities were left unexplored? Tomorrowland
            and EPCOT deeply resonated with me. Their optimistic vision of the
            future, rooted in progress, imagination, and human ingenuity, shaped
            how I see the world. I believe innovation should expand what we love
            rather than replace it and that the future can be brighter than
            today. By building on my education in Computer Hardware Engineering
            from the University of Western Ontario, I aim to develop
            technologies and ideas that help keep that optimism alive, creating
            a future that feels imaginative, thoughtful, and full of
            possibility.
